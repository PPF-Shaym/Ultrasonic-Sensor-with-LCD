# Ultrasonic-Sensor-with-LCD
This project contains the model of an Arduino assembly coupling an ultrasonic sensor with an LCD screen, 
as well as the code to be implemented in the Arduino. 

This assembly is a miniature simulation of the functioning of a sensor that can be found on autonomous cars.

To use it, you need:
- An Arduino card
- An ultrasonic sensor HC-SR04
- A LCD screen
- Some connecting wires
